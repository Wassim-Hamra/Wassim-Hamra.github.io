## **Description:**
A personal portfolio website showcasing my professional experience, skills,
and personal projects, giving you insight into my journey and the work I’m passionate about.

## **Development Process:**

So, here's the scoop on how this website came to life:

🎨 Custom Design:
I started with a template from uicookies as my canvas and transformed it to align with my vision. The HTML and CSS code underwent significant modifications to match my preferences and what I like.
 
🚀 Bootstrap and jQuery:  
To add specific elements and enhance user interactions, I used Bootstrap and jQuery. This allowed me to create a visually engaging UI/UX.

🐍 Python & Django Backend: 
Powered by Django V4.2 and Python, the backend ensures data processing and content administration.

📩 Messages Management: 
I used the integrated python library smtplib to automatically send a personalized email to my personal account to notify me about new newsletter subscribers or new messages from the contact me page that was also stored in a mysql database.

🌐 Dependable Hosting: Originally hosted on Heroku, I later transformed the website into a static version to take advantage of the free web hosting provided by GitHub Pages.

👨🏾‍💻 IDE of Choice: Throughout the development process, I used PyCharm for its seamless version control integration and powerful backend support, making it easier to manage and organize the project.
